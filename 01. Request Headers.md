# WEST RAIDA Request Headers V.1.0.0
This prodocol allows clients to send requests to the WEST RAIDA. 
All requests made to the WEST RAIDA must have a 32 byte header.
The header is fixed length and will always be 32 bytes. 
If the header does not contain 32 bytes, then the RAIDA will not respond. 
The Request Header is not encrypted. 



Headers are made up of four groups of eight bytes. The byte groups are named "Routing", "Presentation", "Encryption" and "Nounce".
This header is designed to allow WEST RAIDAs to be extensible and perfome other functions besides token authentication. (extensible)[#extensible].

All multibyte fields are considered big-endian. For example, the two "ID" byte located at 0x04 and 0x05, 0x04 is MSB and 0x05 is LSB

## WEST RAIDA Protocol Header Byte Group View (32 Bytes Fixed):
```javascript
CL SP RI SH CM CM ID ID  // 8 Routing Bytes
VR AP AP CP TR AI RE RE  // 8 Presentation Bytes
EN DN SN SN SN SN BL BL  // 8 Encryption Bytes
NO NO NO NO NO NO EC EC  // 8 Nounce Bytes
```

### Request Header Byte by Byte Code Meanings

Index (Decimal) | Group | Code | Name | Notes
---|---|---|---|---
0 | Routing | VR | Version  | Version of Routing Header Protocol. Should be 1 
1 | Routing | SP | Split ID | For future use in case the token is to be split. Otherwise zero. 
2 | Routing | DA | Detection Agent  |  DAs also called RAIDA Servers. Value must be 0-24.  
3 | Routing | SH | Shard ID  | For future use in case the token is to be sharded. For now, zero. 
4 | Routing | CG | [Command Group](#command-groups) | High order byte for command number
5 | Routing | CM | [Command](#commands)  | Low Number byte for command number
6 | Routing | ID  |  WEST's RAIDA ID 0 | Allways zero for WEST
7 | Routing | ID  |  WEST's RAIDA ID | Always 1 for WEST
8 | Presentation | VR | Version of PLS | Should be 1
9  | Presentation | AP | Application 0| | Applications are generally numbered by the port they use
10 | Presentation | AP  | Application 1 |  0 means generic. 80 = HTTP, 25 =SMTP etc. 
11 | Presentation | CP | Compression | Future Use. 0 means none (Future Use)
12 | Presentation | TR | Translation | Future Use. 0 means none. Can be used to encode text-based protocols. 
13 | Presentation | AI  |AI Translation | Future Use. 0 means none. What type of AI should be used to translate.
14 | Presentation | RE |  Reserved | Future Use.Can be used if bytes are needed for some unforseen purpose
15 | Presentation | RE |  Reserved | Future Use.
16 | Encryption | EN  | [Encryption](#encryption) Type  |  0x00 means no encryption. See encryption codes table.
17 | Encryption | DE | [Denomination](#denominations) | Denomination of the token used to encrypt the request body.
18 | Encryption | SN | Encryption token SN 0| Serial Number of the token used to encrypt the body. HOB
19 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption token SN 1 | 2nd Highest Order Byte
20 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption token SN 2 |  
21 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption token SN 3| Lowest Order Byte
22 | Encryption | BL | Body Length | Length in bytes of the entire body including the last 2 terminating bytes. 
23 | Encryption | BL | Body Length| LOB. if more than 65K bytes are sent, then these two will be FF FF and bytes 24, 25, 26 and 27 will tokentain the length. 
24 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 0 | The nonce bytes can be used for two purposes in the future if 
25 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 1 | more bytes are needed and the other purpose is random enough.
26 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 2|
27 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 3|
28 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 4 |
29 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 5 
30 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 6 / Echo 0 | Serves two purposes. These last two Nonce bytes are always echoed 
31 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 7 / Echo 1 | back to the client. 

* Nounce can do two jobs. Bytes 30, 31 are used as an Echo also.
* If EN (byte 16) is zero (no encryption) then bytes 17-31 may take any values. In 'no encryption' mode, these values will be ignored except for the two echo bytes. 
* The nounce is also a challenge. The RKE (RAIDA Key Exchange) server must decrypt this and place it in the response if RKE is enabled.

# FUTURE USE

## Ways the WEST Token can be extended:
1. Quantom safe encryption of protocols such as HTTP, SMS, FTB, SMTP, DNS and all other protocols. 
2. Massive compression of the protocls listed above by new encoding mehtods. 
3. Rounting over a private "Wyoming Network".
4. Authentication/Identification of persons and network objects.
5. Key Exchange systems to replace SSL/TLS and quantum vulnerable public key exchage systems such as RSA. 
6. Authentication/Identification of persons and network objects for the so called Internet of things.
7. Storage of files and NFTs
