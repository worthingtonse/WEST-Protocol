# WEST RAIDA Request Headers V.1.0.0
This prodocol allows clients to send requests to the WEST RAIDA. 
All requests made to the WEST RAIDA must have a 32 byte header.
The header is fixed length and will always be 32 bytes. 
If the header does not contain 32 bytes, then the RAIDA will not respond. 
The Request Header is not encrypted. 

Headers are made up of four groups of eight bytes. The byte groups are named "Routing", "Presentation", "Encryption" and "Nounce".
This header is designed to allow WEST RAIDAs to be extensible and perfome other functions besides token authentication such as:

1. Quantom safe encryption of protocols such as HTTP, SMS, FTB, SMTP, DNS and all other protocols. 
2. Massive compression of the protocls listed above by new encoding mehtods. 
3. Rounting over a private "Wyoming Network".
4. Authentication/Identification of persons and network objects.
5. Key Exchange systems to replace SSL/TLS and quantum vulnerable public key exchage systems such as RSA. 
6. Authentication/Identification of persons and network objects for the so called Internet of things. 

## WEST RAIDA Protocol Header (32 Bytes Fixed):
```javascript
CL SP RI SH CM CM ID ID  // 8 Routing Bytes
VR AP AP CP TR AI RE RE  // 8 Presentation Bytes
EN DN SN SN SN SN BL BL  // 8 Encryption Bytes
NO NO NO NO NO NO EC EC  // 8 Nounce Bytes
```

All multibyte fields (ID, SN, NO, EC) are considered big-endian. Literally 4 - MSB, 5 - LSB
00 | 01 | 02 | 03 |04 |05|06|07|08|09|0A||0B|0C|0D|0E|0F
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
CL| SP| RI |SH| CM| CM |ID| ID| VR| AP| AP |CP| TR| AI| RE| RE 
EN |DN |SN |SN |SN |SN |BL |BL| NO| NO |NO| NO |NO |NO| EC| EC 


### Request Header Byte by Byte

index | Group | Code | Name | Notes
---|---|---|---|---
0 | Routing | VR | Version of Routing header  | Should be 1 
1 | Routing | SP | Split ID | For future use in case the token is to be split. Otherwise zero. 
2 | Routing | DA | Detection Agent Index  |  These are the IDs of the actual RAIDA servers. Value must be 0-24.  
3 | Routing | SH | Shard ID  | For future use in case the token is to be sharded. For now, zero. 
4 | Routing | CG | [Command Group](https://github.com/worthingtonse/RAIDAX/blob/CBDC/Request%20Headers.md#command-groups) | High order byte for command number
5 | Routing | CM | [Command](https://github.com/worthingtonse/RAIDAX/blob/CBDC/Request%20Headers.md#commands)  | Low Number byte for command number
6 | Routing | ID  |  Cloud/Coin ID 0 | Allows 65 thousand different coins on the same RAIDA.  
7 | Routing | ID  |  Cloud/[Coin ID](#coin-id) 1 | Least significant byte. See table. 
8 | Presentation | VR | Version of PLS | Should be 1
9  | Presentation | AP | Application 0| | 
10 | Presentation | AP  | Application 1 |  0 means generic. 80 = HTTP, 25 =SMTP etc. 
11 | Presentation | CP | Compression | 0 means none
12 | Presentation | TR | Translation | 0 means none. Can be for using RPC or encoding HTML or HTTP to binary. 
13 | Presentation | AI  |AI Translation | What type of AI should be used to translate data that is contained 
14 | Presentation | RE |  Reserved | Can be used if bytes are needed for some unforseen purpose
15 | Presentation | RE |  Reserved |
16 | Encryption | EN  | [Encryption](https://github.com/worthingtonse/RAIDAX/blob/CBDC/Request%20Headers.md#encryption) Type  |  0x00 means no encryption. See encryption codes table.
17 | Encryption | DE | [Denomination](#denominations) | Denomination of the encryption coin
18 | Encryption | SN | Encryption SN 0| Serial Number of the coin used to encrypt the body. HOB
19 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption SN 1 | 2nd Highes Order Byte
20 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption SN 2 |  
21 | Encryption | SN |  Encryption SN 3| Lowest Order Byte
22 | Encryption | BL | Body Length | The length in bytes of the entire body including the last two terminating bytes. 
23 | Encryption | BL | Body Length| LOB. if more than 65K bytes are sent, then these two will be FF FF and bytes 24,25,26 and 27 will be the length. 
24 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 0 | The nonce bytes can be used for two things in the future if needed
25 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 1 |
26 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 2|
27 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 3|
28 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 4 |
29 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 5 
30 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 6 / Echo 0 | These last two Nonce bytes are always echoed back to the client. 
31 | Nonce | NO |  Nonce 7 / Echo 1 | This allows the clients to pair requests sent with responses received.

* Nounce can do two jobs. Bytes 30, 31 are used as an Echo also.
* If EN (byte 16) is zero (no encryption) then bytes 17-31 may take any values. In 'no encryption' mode, these values will be ignored except for the two echo bytes. 
* The nounce is also a challenge. The RKE server must decrypt this and place it in the response.
